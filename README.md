# Unifed

## Documentation

Documentation for Unifed can be found on the
[Wiki](https://github.com/kiancross/unifed/wiki).

## Automated Testing

On each pull request, automated tests are run. All of these must pass before
the pull request may be merged.

We use [Codecov](https://codecov.io/) to generate test coverage reports. In
order to access the report, you should log into Codecov using your GitHub
account.

Always run `make checks` before pushing code to a pull request and ensure
the checks pass. This preserves our limited GitHub action minutes.

## Synchronisation to School's GitLab

Code pushed to this repository is mirrored to the School's GitLab service at 6am
every morning.
