# Login and Registration

## Logging In

You can login using the email and password that you provided when you registered. You will be taken to your homepage feed.

Note: You will not be able to login if you have not verified your email address (See below).

## Registration

You can register an account using a username, email, name and password.

You must enter the password twice in order to verify that it has been entered correctly.

The password must meet the minimum strength requirements, which are measured using heuristics rather than character/length requirements.

You must confirm that you have read the privacy policy before you can register an account.

On successful submission of the form, you will be sent an email containing a verification link. Accessing this link will verify your email address.

You will then be able to access your account.

## Forgotten Password

If you forget your password, you can enter your email address and get a password reset link sent to you.

Clicking the link will take you to a page where you can set a new password.

This password is subject to the same complexity requirements as on the registration page.

On successful reset, you will be taken to the login page.
