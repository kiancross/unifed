# Registration

You can register an account using a username, email, name and password.

You must enter the password twice in order to verify that it has been entered correctly.

The password must meet the minimum strength requirements, which are measured using heuristics rather than character/length requirements.

You must confirm that you have read the privacy policy before you can register an account.

On successful submission of the form, you will be sent an email containing a verification link. Accessing this link will verify your email address.

You will then be able to access your account.
