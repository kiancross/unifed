# Creating a Post or Comment

## Creating a Post

You can create a post by clicking the 'Make Post' button on a community's posts page. You will then be redirected to the page for creating a post. The created post will then be part of that community.

Enter the post title in the 'title' textbox and the post content in the editor. Details on using the editor can be found [here](../../editor). You can then create the post by clicking the 'make post' button.
