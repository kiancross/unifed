# Reporting a Post or Comment

You can report a post or comment by clicking the 'three dots' icon in the top right of it and then clicking 'Report' from the dropdown.

Reported posts and comments can be approved or rejected by administrators of communities. Instructions for how to do this can be found [here](../moderating-posts/moderating.markdown)

*Note: You can only report other user's posts or comments, not your own.*
