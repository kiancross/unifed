# Editing and Deleting a Post or Comment

Editing and Deleting can be done from the dropdown by clicking the 'three dots' icon in the header of a post or comment.

## Editing a Post or Comment

You can edit a post or comment by clicking the 'edit' option. You will then be provided with an editor to edit the content of the post or comment and, if you are editing a post, a title textbox.
