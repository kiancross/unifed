### Fenced code blocks

You can create fenced code blocks by placing triple backticks <code>\`\`\`</code> before and after the code block. We recommend placing a blank line before and after code blocks to make the raw formatting easier to read.

<pre>
```
function test() {
  console.log("notice the blank line before this function?");
}
```
</pre>

### Syntax highlighting

You can add an optional language identifier to enable syntax highlighting in your fenced code block.

For example, to syntax highlight Ruby code:

    ```ruby
    require 'redcarpet'
    markdown = Redcarpet.new("Hello World!")
    puts markdown.to_html
    ```
